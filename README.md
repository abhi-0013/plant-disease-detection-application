This repository contains the source code and additional resources for a Plant Disease Detection Android application. The application is designed to help users identify diseases in plants by analyzing images taken with their smartphone camera. It utilizes machine learning techniques to classify the disease and provides the confidence and accuracy of the prediction.

## Features

- **Image Input**: Users can take a picture of a plant using the smartphone camera within the application.
- **Disease Classification**: The application employs machine learning algorithms to analyze the input image and classify the disease affecting the plant.
- **Confidence and Accuracy**: Along with the disease classification, the application provides the confidence level and accuracy of the prediction.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the application.
- **Offline Support**: The application is capable of processing images and making predictions even when the device is not connected to the internet.
- **High Accuracy**: The underlying machine learning models are trained on a diverse dataset, resulting in accurate disease detection and classification.
